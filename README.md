# Harley_code_friend_example
this piece of code is an example made by my friend, Harley Rombout, to show what is possible.
This python codework is made by a friend in the Netherlands, by name of Harley Rombout. He offered to make me it as an example of what is possible with more experience
in coding. Like mentioned in my critical evaluation, when you don't have the proper skillset it might be a good idea to work together with someone who does;
so the work can be divided and you both can do what you're good at. 

I have his permission to upload it to my Github.
If there are any questions for him, you can either contact me, or reach him at the messager app "discord" at "Morrowind3#9623"
